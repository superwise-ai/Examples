## This example notebook shows that while natural language interaction with a dataset, i.e. a pandas dataframe or an sql database, can work fine for simple requests of the data, when queries become more complex a request to an LLM does not return a result.  [dsl-spa](https://github.com/superwise-ai/dsl-spa) is an open source capability that in addition to other capabilities addresses this problem.

## In this example, we will interact with a simple dataframe using an LLM.  We will show the challenge with a complex query.  Then employ dsl-spa to address this challenge.
